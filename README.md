# Chordal Flag Averaging

## Description

A package for computing chordal means and medians on flags. 

See `GettingStarted/` for simple usage of chordal means and medians on flags in matlab and python

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

See `requirements.txt` for Python dependencies. Was built with Python 3.8.8.

### Quick Start (Python)

1. Initialize conda environment

    ```
    conda create --name chordal_flag_averaging python=3.8.8
    conda activate chordal_flag_averaging
    ```

1. Install requirements

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

1. Open `./GettingStarted/example.ipynb` and run it within the `chordal_flag_averaging` environment.

`example.ipynb` shows how to compute:

* chordal flag mean
* chordal flag median
